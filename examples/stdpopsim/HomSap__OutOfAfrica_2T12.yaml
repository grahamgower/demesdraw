description: The model is derived from the Tennesen et al. analysis of the jSFS from
  European Americans and African Americans. It describes the ancestral human population
  in Africa, the out of Africa event, and two distinct periods of subsequent European
  population growth over the past 23kya. Model parameters are taken from Fig. S5 in
  Fu et al.
