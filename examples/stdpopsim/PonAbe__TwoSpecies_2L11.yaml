description: The two orang-utan species, Sumatran (Pongo abelii) and Bornean (Pongo
  pygmaeus) inferred from the joint-site frequency spectrum with ten individuals from
  each population. This model is an isolation-with- migration model, with exponential
  growth or decay in each population after the split. The Sumatran population grows
  in size, while the Bornean population slightly declines.
