description: "This is the best-fitting model of a history of multiple ancient and\
  \ present-day human populations sampled across Eurasia over the past 120,000 years.\
  \ The fitting was performed using momi2 (Kamm et al. 2019), which uses the multi-population\
  \ site-frequency spectrum as input data. The model includes a ghost admixture event\
  \ (from unsampled basal Eurasians into early European farmers), and two admixture\
  \ events where the source is approximately well-known (from Neanderthals into Non-Africans\
  \ and from Western European hunter-gatherers into modern Sardinians. There are three\
  \ present-day populations: Sardinians, Han Chinese and African Mbuti. Additionally,\
  \ there are several ancient samples obtained from fossils dated at different times\
  \ in the past: the Altai Neanderthal (Prufer et al. 2014), a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer\
  \ (Lazaridis et al. 2014), a Neolithic early European sample (Lazaridis et al. 2014),\
  \ and two Palaeolithic modern humans from Siberia - MA1 (Raghavan et al. 2014) and\
  \  Ust'Ishim (Fu et al. 2014). All the ancient samples are represented by a single\
  \ diploid genome."
