description: This was the best fit model of Ashkenazi Jewish demographic history from
  Gladstein and Hammer 2019, shown in Figure 1, labeled "Substructure Model". Model
  choice and parameter estimation were performed with Approximate Bayesian Computation.
  Parameter values are based on the mode from ABC found in Table S3 of Gladstein and
  Hammer 2019. In this model, the ancestors of Europeans and Middle Eastern populations
  diverge. Non-Ashkenazi Jewish populations then diverge from the Middle Eastern population.
  The Ashkenazi Jews then diverge from the other Jewish populations and experience
  a substantial reduction in population size and a single pulse of gene flow from
  Europeans (corresponding to their arrival in Europe). After the gene flow from Europeans
  to the Ashkenazi Jews, the Ashkenazi Jews split into two groups, the Western and
  Eastern. Finally, the Western Ashkenazi Jews experience moderate instantaneous population
  size increase, and the Eastern experience a massive population size increase. In
  addition to the demographic model Gladstein and Hammer 2019 also incorporated an
  SNP array ascertainment scheme into the simulation. This demographic model does
  not include the SNP array ascertainment scheme. It should be noted that Gladstein
  and Hammer 2019 simulated with a mutation rate of 2.5e-8.
