description: Model estimated from site frequency spectrum of synonymous SNPs from
  African (South Middle Atlas) samples using Williamson et al. 2005 methodology. Values
  come from supplementary table 1 of Huber et al 2018. Sizes change from N_A -> N_2
  -> N_3 and t_2 is the time of the second epoch and t_3 is the time of the 3rd epoch.
