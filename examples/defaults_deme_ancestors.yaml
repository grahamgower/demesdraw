description: Setting deme ancestor and proportion values using defaults.
time_units: generations

defaults:
  deme:
    ancestors: [deme0, deme1]
    proportions: [0.5, 0.5]
    start_time: 1
  epoch: {start_size: 1}

demes:
# Two ancestor demes. We must set the ancestor and proportion values
# explicitly to the empty list because the defaults fields override
# the static defaults from the schema.
- name: deme0
  ancestors: []
  proportions: []
  start_time: .inf
- ancestors: []
  name: deme1
  proportions: []
  start_time: .inf
# Two child demes, both of which inherit from deme0 and deme1, as set
# by the defaults.
